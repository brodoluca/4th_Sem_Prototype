## Project Description
The project consists of an amphibious car with rescue capabilities. The prototype is based on an ambulance. The vehicle is able to drive on water and on all terrain.  



## Getting Started


#### Prerequisites


To run the simulation you need either a Windows Computer or a Linux computer with Ros installed


#### Install and build
In case of the Cpp simulation, what is needed is a simple compiler. Compile the program with required dependencies  found in the rep.
For Ros, you can just copy-paste the package on your workspace and run it.


## Versioning
    Ubuntu 18.04
    Ros Melodic
    Visual Studio 19
    Eclipse 2020-03 with Papyrus installed
    XCode 11.5

## License

We do not think that in the current situation the project, code in particular, is good enough to be used in a real situation. Please contact the owner of the repository if some parts of the code are going to be used.
